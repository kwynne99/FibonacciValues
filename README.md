# FibonacciValues
Project for Discrete Structures Class
Created a program to find exact values for Fibonacci Sequence.
Implemented the cpp_int - big_int class from boost.org to find exact values.
Created recursive and iterative function for finding values, and implemented ability to find prime numbers.
Added feature to display how many nanoseconds for each function ran.
May create another function to make main cleaner by putting time elapsed and cout into it.
